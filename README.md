Comparison of death per 1 million inhabitant per week in US and EU states

In the attached notebook, I detail the code and sources I used to produce the following graph:
https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~kleempoe/1/#/

Briefly, I
1.	Downloaded data per US and EU states
2.	Calculated new deaths per day from total deaths
3.	Scaled the number of deaths per 1 Million inhabitant
4.	Calculated the sum of death per week
5.	Plotted the data in Plotly 

There may be some errors in the data and I did not extensively clean it, but I believe the general trends are correct.
